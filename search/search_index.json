You may notice that this note is a lot more wordy than later notes, and that is because I discovered idea notes and atomic notes. While this journey demonstrates the learning and thinking I did about course content, it also demonstrates my note taking and technological journey. With that out of the way, this is the note that started it all. This note discussed many things about the structure of networks and how things interact with each other. Emergence out of networks, assemblage theory, and contextualizing ideas as space and time continued as themes throughout the course.</p> </li> <li> <p>@tullyVictorianEcologicalDisaster2009 In this source note I summarized John Tully's 2009 journal article \"A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph and Gutta-Percha\". The note and reading discusses perhaps the more negative side of networks, and how underwater telegraph systems were able to emerge at the expense of workers and environments in Southeast Asia. Everything is a network, including the network of exploitation behind many technological advancements. </p> </li> <li> <p>International_telegraphy This note details some key dates for the Atlantic telegraph advancement. This of course connects to the prior reading as this gives some context to the key figures and dates behind the more political reason for the gutta percha resource assault. This note also connects to the contextualization of time and space, and how people all of a sudden had new communication networks faster than ever.</p> </li> <li> <p>Peoples_network This note again details more of the political side of building an international telegraph network, and the spin offs of that. Specifically,  without telegraph communication networks the Communist Manifesto is not written and the scramble for Africa does not happen. It proves the importance of networks in history, as many major events would not have happened without the rapid communication enabled by telegraphs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Telegraph_network This note features a diagram of US telegraph network. There is an emphasis on the East Coast which signals how the system emerged. Again, themes of communication, time and space shrinking, and networks are present.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>network_science Jumping pretty far from Telegraph_network and that time period, network_science is set in the early 2000s. There is obviously a technological gap there. We have jumped from telegraph networks to the web and the internet. The branch of network science proved that networksare everywhere and important enough to be studied and understood in the context of the modern internet.  </p> </li> <li> <p>the_google Another jump from the context of network science is the emergence of Google. When talking about things that emerge from networks, Google is an idea that emerged as a result of the web, and 20 years later is now what most people think of when they think of the internet. It is the assemblage between the web which has now become so intertwined and almost synonymous with the monolith that is Google.</p> </li> <li> <p>enshittification Finally, we arrive at the metaphorical destination which is the note about enshittification. In a way, a note about this topic is fitting for the end of the journey since it is generally how technology meets its' end as well. Going from the first note to here took us through exploitation networks, telegraph networks, network science, and Google and web networks. Just like enshittification is a cycle, networks could also be a metaphorical cycle. Some networks have even been enshittified themselves, like many web browsers in the early internet. This journey proves that the most powerful thing I learned in this course is that everything is a network, and networks are extremely significant to learning about history. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Below are links to the miscellaneous notes that were not involved in a past memex:</p> <p>enshittification the_google network_science Archaeology (Theoretical Framework for Course)</p>"},{"location":"final_journey/0_final_journey_1/#networks","title":"networks","text":"<p>This tag is an obvious one.

In the vein of developing analytical thinking and historical analysis skills, it was pretty amateur (to be fair I am still pretty amateur, I have just gotten slightly better). Analyzing this source definitely contributed to learning cool things, my definition of cool at least, as it provided the basis for a lot of concepts covered in the course including network theories and tech developments. This note is a good starting point for the journey as it shows what my base point was for thinking and notetaking at the start of the course.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015 In a second source note in this journey from part one, my beginner analytical thinking was again still developing. Like in my source note for @bushWeMayThink1945 I did not include a paragraph summary and just had key details extracted in jot form from the source, which is useful, but a paragraph summary demonstrates better understanding of the subject. This note pretty heavily connects to @bushWeMayThink1945 as the garden in Caulfield's writing seems to draw from ideas in Bush's memex. </p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>@coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015 In this note, my historical thinking had developed further from part one. A little later in the course and post first memex evaluation, I had some feedback under my belt that translated into analysis skills. This source note notably involves key points as well as a summary of the important things in the source, demonstrating developed thinking and analysis. I also was including connections to class material which I had not done as much during part one. As far as learning cool stuff, some people may not think that a history of fax machines is cool, but in relation to the course and other tech learned in the course, I found it interesting how other tech quickly flourished while even at its peak faxing kind of flopped.</p> </li> <li> </li> <li> <p>@DialupModemBBS The final note in this journey is one of the last source notes I did for the course. My summary is more developed in this note than the last, proving analysis skill development. I have linked to a variety of atomic/idea notes as well as class content, proving that I was contextualizing and putting into a framework everything I was learning. This content was cool to me as I love learning about the unrecognized and localized groups that develop things behind the larger shadow of a government organization. It related to a lot of things in the course like networks and communication as well. </p> </li> </ul> <p>In this course I learned cool things, developed my analytical thinking and historical frameworks as demonstrated in the above journey. </p>"},{"location":"final_journey/0_final_journey_2/#networks","title":"networks","text":"<p>The notes that I tagged under #networks involve a network or network in some form.

Many people drew links between prominent figures in internet history and ARPANET, which demonstrates the reach that the project had on the field. If it is looked at another way however, that could also mean that this is just the people and projects that the story tends to focus on. Overall, the fact that so many connections were   found in just a few minutes during class shows that the history of the internet is somewhat of an internet itself.

Also, the chatbot misses the whole point of Section 230. It never states that Section 230 lets companies/websites get away with having illegal content from third parties because the website cannot be treated as the publisher (Newton, 2020). This is obviously a big issue as companies like Facebook can keep illegal content, such as terrorism, that makes them money up on the site and not be held responsible for it.

From telegraphs to ARPANET every technology has a complicated web of people, resources and companies behind it. </p> <p>I was driving home (Ottawa - Strathroy, ON) yesterday and drove on highways 417, 416, 401, 418, 407, and 402. I drove through what had to be 100 municipalities and a few Indigenous reserves. It made me wonder about the network behind the highway system in Ontario. Of course on the surface, the highways themselves are networks. Metaphorically they carry information (people &amp; cars) from one host to another (point A to point B), and interchange between one and another sharing information and roads. But to dig deeper, what is behind that? Who wanted to build the highway? Who actually built the highway? Who did not want the highway built? How did all of those people interact with the municipalities and Indigenous communities that own the land the highways are built on? </p> <p>This also prompted me to think about highway_413 . </p> <p>You might think that this is a random note to have in a memex about the history of the internet, but I would disagree. If the internet is a place, it is an \"information superhighway\", and so is the network of 400 series highways in Ontario.

One might compare grassroots activism surrounding abortion rights, or really anything, with this same phenomena. There are on the ground organizations doing great work to support people who need abortions, and yet the same few large organizations receive all the donations. because anyone who isn't 'in the know' donates to them. For example, if Planned Parenthood is ARPANET, modems are a local organization that actively participates in community outreach and funding. While both organizations  do good for people who need help, one is more community oriented. Of course, this is is a loose analogy, and is just meant to describe how this is a phenomena that comes up in history.

There is labour, shipping, purchasing, etc. involved in that network.  The trade networks behind many modern 'convenience' technologies has more of an impact than people may think.

People could dial in to swap messages and information, and before long there was at least one dial-up BBS in most cities in North America.  Like social media, people could socialize, organize, and connect with people of similar identities. There were BBS networks for a plethoria of identities including 2SLGBTQIA+ people and people of colour. There were BBS networks for environmental activism and peace activists.

Photographers used carrier pigeons to carry memory cards and a company in South Africa in 2009 hosted a pigeon race.
