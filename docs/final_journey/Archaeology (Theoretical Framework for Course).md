**Etymology**
- proto indo-European "Teks" meaning "to weave"
- teks -> technology
- implies system of knowledge/practical things
**Prehistorical Internet
- loom punchcards -> people develop them into coding punchcards
	- enables industrialization and replication of weaving patterns
	- women used these machines for weaving
		- history of the internet built on the backs of women
- in archaeology, you need a conception of the labour of the history that you encounter
- what you believe about the past has an effect on how you retrieve it
* core rope memory for moon mission woven by a team of women
**Why do we need archaeology?
- because of the things of history we want to explore as well as places in history
	- EX: look at the history of the internet in the things that were created and how we use them but also the spin offs and physical implications (rare earth minerals, which becomes geopolitical)
	- physicality of the internet: hard to find unless you really know where to look
- archaeology is the science of human duration
	- ex: routes for telegraph become fibre optic and telephone routes which also becomes geopolitical
**The Point**
- theory is a framework for what we think is important in the world
- when we make that explicit it helps guide the type of questions we ask
- many different theories order our observations
**Questions From A Worker Who Reads
- looking beyond what we think we know
- questioning who were the workers? who built the history that we study
- social archaeology, gendered archaeology
**Space Economy**
- by reconfiguring space economies we rethink how we live
	- EX: telegraph cables being built between England and New York collapses a two week message to two minutes
- space/economy patterns matter
**Complicated Vs Complex**
- complex system: waves emerging out of localized interactions
	- involves feedback loops
	- EX: Queensway
- complicated system: if one thing breaks the whole thing falls apart
	- EX: Rocketship
- particular network shapes enable emergence
	- can measure networks of humans, machines, institutions
	- measurement affects flow, places of emergence, feedback loops
**Assemblage Theory**
- agencement: things come together
	- things have an agency and an activability on their own
	- how action gets distributed over networks of humans and nonhumans
	- EX: Potter
		- potter has an idea, ties to a relationship with the clay, related to the wheel, related to the final product
		- its an assemblage and a network
- meaning depends on context:
	- both internal
	- external (in time)
	- external (in space)
	- nothing is meaningful on its own
- perspectivism: 
	- try to mirror natural breakages but there are many ways to make the decisions
	- categories emerge from engagement with the material
	- how we decide what is important matters
**Summarization
- a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two or more entities
	- we need to look at what flows between them
	- info, power, obligation
	- think of feedback
- things emerge from networks
	- they leave a physical trace in the world
		- archaeological sites provide evidence of past networks
- complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in network shapes
- networks provide formal mechanism for computation
- network is an answer to a question
	- presupposes answer when certain things flow through it
- components of networked history are not just objects but also the assemblage
- to be human is to be smeared through and across our things and into each other
	- we are entangled with our things
	- history of the internet relates to our entanglement with devices and internet
- meanings that we bring are contingent on our own backgrounds and how we approach things
**Confusing Things
- how do people look at a weaving loom and somehow that turns into the laptop that i own?
**Questions for inquiring into the internet:**
- what are the social/political/economic contexts of the people, places, things?
- what are the assemblages that make this thing up?
- how do those assemblages extend in time or space?
- how do networks intersect?
- what drives network evolution? who/what are key players?
- how do we study such things?
