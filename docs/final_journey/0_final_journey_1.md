One of the most powerful things I learned in this course and a central theme throughout my memex is that everything is a network, and networks are a key part of history. This has changed the way I think about history, government systems, schools, roadways, and more. I believe this is demonstrated in the Journey between "Archaeology (Theoretical Framework for Course)" and "enshittification".


## The Journey Between Archaeology (Theoretical Framework for Course) and enshittification
- [[Archaeology (Theoretical Framework for Course)]]
This note covered A LOT. You may notice that this note is a lot more wordy than later notes, and that is because I discovered idea notes and atomic notes. While this journey demonstrates the learning and thinking I did about course content, it also demonstrates my note taking and technological journey. With that out of the way, this is the note that started it all. This note discussed many things about the structure of networks and how things interact with each other. Emergence out of networks, assemblage theory, and contextualizing ideas as space and time continued as themes throughout the course.

- [[@tullyVictorianEcologicalDisaster2009]]
In this source note I summarized John Tully's 2009 journal article "A Victorian Ecological Disaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph and Gutta-Percha". The note and reading discusses perhaps the more negative side of networks, and how underwater telegraph systems were able to emerge at the expense of workers and environments in Southeast Asia. Everything is a network, including the network of exploitation behind many technological advancements. 

- [[International_telegraphy]]
This note details some key dates for the Atlantic telegraph advancement. This of course connects to the prior reading as this gives some context to the key figures and dates behind the more political reason for the gutta percha resource assault. This note also connects to the contextualization of time and space, and how people all of a sudden had new communication networks faster than ever.

- [[Peoples_network]]
This note again details more of the political side of building an international telegraph network, and the spin offs of that. Specifically,  without telegraph communication networks the Communist Manifesto is not written and the scramble for Africa does not happen. It proves the importance of networks in history, as many major events would not have happened without the rapid communication enabled by telegraphs.

- [[Telegraph_network]]
This note features a diagram of US telegraph network. There is an emphasis on the East Coast which signals how the system emerged. Again, themes of communication, time and space shrinking, and networks are present.

- #networks
This tag is an obvious one. Why would any note under the tag "networks" prove anything other than the importance of networks? 

- [[network_science]]
Jumping pretty far from [[Telegraph_network]] and that time period, [[network_science]] is set in the early 2000s. There is obviously a technological gap there. We have jumped from telegraph networks to the web and the internet. The branch of network science proved that networksare everywhere and important enough to be studied and understood in the context of the modern internet.  

- [[the_google]]
Another jump from the context of network science is the emergence of Google. When talking about things that emerge from networks, Google is an idea that emerged as a result of the web, and 20 years later is now what most people think of when they think of the internet. It is the assemblage between the web which has now become so intertwined and almost synonymous with the monolith that is Google.

- [[enshittification]]
Finally, we arrive at the metaphorical destination which is the note about enshittification. In a way, a note about this topic is fitting for the end of the journey since it is generally how technology meets its' end as well. Going from the first note to here took us through exploitation networks, telegraph networks, network science, and Google and web networks. Just like enshittification is a cycle, networks could also be a metaphorical cycle. Some networks have even been enshittified themselves, like many web browsers in the early internet. This journey proves that the most powerful thing I learned in this course is that everything is a network, and networks are extremely significant to learning about history.
