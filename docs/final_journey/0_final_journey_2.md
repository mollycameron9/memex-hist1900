During the tutorial level I set out the aims of developing my analytical thinking, historical framework and learning cool things. The success of these aims is demonstrated in the journey between [[@bushWeMayThink1945]] and [[@DialupModemBBS]].

## The Journey Between @bushWeMayThink1945 and @weingartRouteTextMessage2019
- [[@bushWeMayThink1945]]
This source note was one of the first readings I did for the course. In the vein of developing analytical thinking and historical analysis skills, it was pretty amateur (to be fair I am still pretty amateur, I have just gotten slightly better). Analyzing this source definitely contributed to learning cool things, my definition of cool at least, as it provided the basis for a lot of concepts covered in the course including network theories and tech developments. This note is a good starting point for the journey as it shows what my base point was for thinking and notetaking at the start of the course.

- #networks 
The notes that I tagged under #networks involve a network or network in some form. Generally something regarding technological networks like telegraphs or telephones. Through the course, I started using more specific tags rather than just "networks", evidenced later in the journey. However, using the network tag was still useful to my learning, as I could search for things under that umbrella term that covered so much of the course. To connect [[@bushWeMayThink1945]] and [[@mikecaulfieldGardenStreamTechnopastoral2015]], both notes were tagged under networks as both discussed some version of a network of information and ideas.

In a second source note in this journey from part one, my beginner analytical thinking was again still developing. Like in my source note for [[@bushWeMayThink1945]] I did not include a paragraph summary and just had key details extracted in jot form from the source, which is useful, but a paragraph summary demonstrates better understanding of the subject. This note pretty heavily connects to [[@bushWeMayThink1945]] as the garden in Caulfield's writing seems to draw from ideas in Bush's memex. 

- #communication 
The source note above, I tagged communication because it discusses ways to communicate ideas through a garden-like network. The below note is tagged communication in a more literal sense that it is about fax machines and classic point A to point B communication. Any note tagged under communication would pretty self explanatorily involve some tie to communication. Which is a lot of notes for this course. Throughout the course I found myself still tagging notes under these more generic categories, but I found that helpful since those categories were integral themes for the course. 

- [[@coopersmithFaxedRiseFall2015]]
In this note, my historical thinking had developed further from part one. A little later in the course and post first memex evaluation, I had some feedback under my belt that translated into analysis skills. This source note notably involves key points as well as a summary of the important things in the source, demonstrating developed thinking and analysis. I also was including connections to class material which I had not done as much during part one. As far as learning cool stuff, some people may not think that a history of fax machines is cool, but in relation to the course and other tech learned in the course, I found it interesting how other tech quickly flourished while even at its peak faxing kind of flopped.

- #invention
A slightly less generic tag, but lets not dog on her! Fax machines were inventions! Dial up modems were inventions! Everything is an invention and it all built off of each other and it was all and network and it all connects! Or so I have been told by Dr. Graham and every reading for this course. Again, this tag connects notes that connect to the overarching course theme of invention. The history of the internet would not exist if people sat on their butts all day and didn't invent things. Many of the things that I found it cool to learn about in the course were in fact the various inventions layered through the content. 

- [[@DialupModemBBS]]
The final note in this journey is one of the last source notes I did for the course. My summary is more developed in this note than the last, proving analysis skill development. I have linked to a variety of atomic/idea notes as well as class content, proving that I was contextualizing and putting into a framework everything I was learning. This content was cool to me as I love learning about the unrecognized and localized groups that develop things behind the larger shadow of a government organization. It related to a lot of things in the course like networks and communication as well. 


In this course I learned cool things, developed my analytical thinking and historical frameworks as demonstrated in the above journey.
