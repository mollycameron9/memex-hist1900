### Summary & Key Take Aways
- early days of libraries being local and individual practice
- classification: helps in arranging documents  on shelves in  a systematic order (Kumar, p. 45, 2013)
- catalogue:  gelps in organising, identifying, and locating the required documents (Kumar, p. 45, 2013)
	- library catalogue: list and index to library's collection
- technology influenced the functions of a catalogue
	- while catalogues in theory do not rely on a physical form
- OPAC systems online allow people to access library materials from anywhere
	- so much information just at our fingertips
- this article is 10 years old, how much more development in library tech has happened since?
	- language like "downloadable e-media" (Kumar, p. 53, 2013) dates the article in a way, now most people hear media and immediately think of the internet or online materials without needing the "e" indicator
