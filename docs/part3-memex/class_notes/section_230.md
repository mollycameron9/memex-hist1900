Communications Decency Act
- anti porn etc series of laws
- danger that it was going to snuff out the web in the desire to think of the children

section 230 important
- allowed to remain
- we should be responsible for our own actions but not those of others
- excuse for platforms to not remove actual illegal stuff
- so much stuff shielded by this 

website owners had powerful incentive not to moderate websites at all because they would be found liable for the stuff they didn't catch
