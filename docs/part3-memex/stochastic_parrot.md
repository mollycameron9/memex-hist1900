The chatbot had a habit of getting minor details about historical facts wrong, such as saying the "CDA was passed into law on February 15th, 2006" when the CDA was passed in 1995, as noticed by Jen using: https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/senate-bill/314. Also, the chatbot misses the whole point of Section 230. It never states that Section 230 lets companies/websites get away with having illegal content from third parties because the website cannot be treated as the publisher (Newton, 2020). This is obviously a big issue as companies like Facebook can keep illegal content, such as terrorism, that makes them money up on the site and not be held responsible for it. This was also discussed in class on March 27. 

A key way to tell if material is from an AI is if it brings up points and never really backs them up. They aren't based in anything and it just comes across as word vomit (which is kind of what AI writing is anyways). In this article, it mentions Section 230 and how it has been highly contested, but it never actually states what Section 230 was specifically meant to do.
