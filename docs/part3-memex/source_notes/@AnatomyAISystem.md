### Summary & Key Take Aways

AI is so common in today's technological age that it is woven in the software of homes. Devices like Amazon's Alexa use AI software to turn on lights, call friends, and figure out today's weather. What people don't realize about their AI assistants is the massive network required to power it. 
The devices - and much other software, this is very common - need minerals and materials from around the globe. An example of this is the lithium batteries that are mined in Bolivia. There is labour, shipping, purchasing, etc. involved in that network. 
The trade networks behind many modern 'convenience' technologies has more of an impact than people may think. This is just another way to prove that everything is a network, which in my opinion has been a central theme of HIST 1900.
