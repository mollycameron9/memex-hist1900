I read this text with the aim of answering the questions I thought about in [[everything_is_a_network]], and on my lengthy drive home yesterday.

Who wanted to build the highway? Why?
- Doug Ford's Conservatives
- to invest in infrastructure 

Who actually built the highway? 
- it has not yet been built but the plans are on the table. with Ford's record of hiring out jobs to his buddies I would assume the construction would be done by a company he is close with

Who did not want the highway built? 
- Minister of Transportation Caroline Mulroney
- Many reports and audits done
- environmental groups who do not want the highway to cut through the greenbelt

How did all of those people interact with the municipalities and Indigenous communities that own the land the highways are built on?
- again, the highway has not yet been built, but this quote from the article sums up my thoughts "Governments can make any decision governments want to make"
- anything can happen
