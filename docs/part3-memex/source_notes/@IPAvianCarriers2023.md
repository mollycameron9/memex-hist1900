### Summary & Key Take Aways

- this is ridiculous
- let it be known that I was in such disbelief reading this article that I did further research and found a link to Waitzman's original memo: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2549
	- while that was an April Fool's Day joke, I cannot believe that people actually implemented this


What started as an April Fool's Day joke proposal in 1999 somehow wove its way into Australian politics in 2009. IP over Avian Carriers was described as a way to carry Internet Protocol traffic by birds. Once actually implemented, it is inefficient, and suffers many risks to information carrying. Some risks are dangers to carriers ie. birds of prey, disease, and an absence of viable local carriers. Of course, the possibility of IPoAC is infeasible but that hasn't stopped people from implementing it jokingly.
Photographers used carrier pigeons to carry memory cards and a company in South Africa in 2009 hosted a pigeon race. In 2009 the Australian government said that if the opposition had their way telecommunications would be done via carrier pigeon, so TV show *Hungry Beast* raced a pigeon against a car and an internet provider. Turns out Australians may have been better off using carrier pigeon.
