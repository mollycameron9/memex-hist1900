### Summary & Key Take Aways

The internet can only exist as a function of the protocols that it is based on. An example of one of these protocols is HTML (hypertext markup language) which was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee as a new way to share documents and information. Berners-Lee then created a browser called World Wide Web which allowed users to see other HTML documents and create their own. In the same year that the World Wide Web was created, America Online (AOL) allowed users to communicate through chat rooms and Instant 
Messenger. 

Many businesses and websites were created during the "dot-com boom" of the 90s and subsequently failed later during the "dot-com crash". However it was the shared protocols learned during that time that provided for the growth of the internet and the early days of social media.
