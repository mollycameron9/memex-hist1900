### Summary & Key Take Aways
- the general population only knows a basic history of the internet, and does not know what that leaves out

- college students specifically :
	- US govt, Silicon Valley, military, nuclear war (Driscoll, 2022)
	- that leaves out details of competencies, female workers behind the scenes, and any work done in a. country other than America

- leaves out: 
	- grassroots, local networks that foreshadowed blogs & social media (Driscoll, 2022)


When most people think about the history of the internet, they tend to focus on the broader government initiatives such as ARPANET, and ignore the smaller, community led developments. One such development is bulletin board systems, which allowed people to communicate ideas locally. It might be described as an early form of social media, but it was closer to a regular cork bulletin board. People could dial in to swap messages and information, and before long there was at least one dial-up BBS in most cities in North America. 
Like social media, people could socialize, organize, and connect with people of similar identities. There were BBS networks for a plethoria of identities including 2SLGBTQIA+ people and people of colour. There were BBS networks for environmental activism and peace activists. Like today's social media, there were also neo-Nazi groups and right-wing extremists on BBS networks. In the mid-90s, the World Wide Web became the future of the internet, and money and attention left BBSs, which led to them vanishing.
