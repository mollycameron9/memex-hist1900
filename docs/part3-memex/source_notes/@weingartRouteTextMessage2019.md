### Summary & Key Take Aways

There is more to a text message than what meets the eye. First, the message must be typed on the screen and received through the electrodes/currents in the phone. Then it is translated and stored in the machine via a combination of bits, bytes, and hex codes. The message must still be sent, so it goes to the SIM card and contextual data is added. This data tells the network where to send the message, and the message is sent to a cell tower and then the receiver. 

That very summarized and simplified version of what goes into a text message is just the beginning of the amount of technology behind something we do everyday. Each character in the text requires code within the message in the phone, and that doesn't factor in what would happen if the two phones were on different networks. Along with all of the machine coding, humans have to understand the messages that are being sent and sometimes decode hidden meanings behind those messages.
