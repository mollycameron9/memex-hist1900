- in an attempt to remove complications from society (inconviently long communication times) we have implemented insanely complicated technology

- even telegraphy was fairly simple compared to the technology, coding, and software that is needed to send a text message
	- morse code on wire, message go far, message received and stored
	- obviously that is oversimplified, but the point still stands

- i understand that the complicated software is needed to have the convenience of a text message, but there is irony in it all, isn't there?
