In my opinion a central takeaway from this class has been that everything is a network. From telegraphs to ARPANET every technology has a complicated web of people, resources and companies behind it. 

I was driving home (Ottawa - Strathroy, ON) yesterday and drove on highways 417, 416, 401, 418, 407, and 402. I drove through what had to be 100 municipalities and a few Indigenous reserves. It made me wonder about the network behind the highway system in Ontario. Of course on the surface, the highways themselves are networks. Metaphorically they carry information (people & cars) from one host to another (point A to point B), and interchange between one and another sharing information and roads. But to dig deeper, what is behind that? Who wanted to build the highway? Who actually built the highway? Who did not want the highway built? How did all of those people interact with the municipalities and Indigenous communities that own the land the highways are built on? 

This also prompted me to think about [[highway_413]] . 

You might think that this is a random note to have in a memex about the history of the internet, but I would disagree. If the internet is a place, it is an "information superhighway", and so is the network of 400 series highways in Ontario. Just as today's capitalist hellscape society could not function without the web, it could not function without major highways.

Everything, including major highway systems, is a network.
