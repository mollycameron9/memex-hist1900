If the modem was the grassroots and community oriented 'alternative' to ARPANET, what does that compare to in the modern day? 
One might compare grassroots activism surrounding abortion rights, or really anything, with this same phenomena. There are on the ground organizations doing great work to support people who need abortions, and yet the same few large organizations receive all the donations. because anyone who isn't 'in the know' donates to them. For example, if Planned Parenthood is ARPANET, modems are a local organization that actively participates in community outreach and funding. While both organizations  do good for people who need help, one is more community oriented. Of course, this is is a loose analogy, and is just meant to describe how this is a phenomena that comes up in history.
Both ARPANET and modems helped forward the development of network technology, but one was more accessible to local and community people.
