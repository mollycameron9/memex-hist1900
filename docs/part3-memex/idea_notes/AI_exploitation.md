I HATE CAPITALISM 

"A child working in a mine in the Congo would need more than 700 000 years of non-stop work to earn the same amount as a single day of Bezos' income" (Crawford & Joler , 2017).

Lets unpack that:

1. **CHILDREN** are working in these mines to get the minerals needed for the technology that we are very blas√© about and just regard as every day life
2. Either Bezos makes an astronomical amount of money (true) or the children are being paid dirt (also true)
3. Kids are being unfairly exploited for hard labour when the people at the top make billions
