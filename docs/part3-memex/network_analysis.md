In the network analysis activity I found a link between Elizabeth 'Jake' Feinler and ARPANET. I drew on information from my lecture notes from March 15 [[early_networks]]. Jake Feinler developed the database to keep record of the hosts at ARPANET and kept it updated physically and digitally. 
Many people drew links between prominent figures in internet history and ARPANET, which demonstrates the reach that the project had on the field. If it is looked at another way however, that could also mean that this is just the people and projects that the story tends to focus on.
Overall, the fact that so many connections were   found in just a few minutes during class shows that the history of the internet is somewhat of an internet itself. I would be willing to bet that if you study the history of just about anything, a similar internetworking of people, companies, and other influences could be made.
