- "His excursions may be more enjoyable if he can reaquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he does not need to have readily at hand..." (Bush, 1945)
	- while Bush was writing in 1945 and never could have predicted the scale of information that anyone with a cellphone can access, this reminds me of today's internet culture
	- i know too many things about too many things and people
- reminds me of this opinion piece from Michelle Goldberg
	- https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/opinion/facebook-social-media-problems.html
	- connection through social media has been negative
	- if we didn't communicate with each other as much as we did we might actually be able to get along with people
		- in other words, there is too much noise and inconsequential things available to us
- also reminds me of a conversation I had with my mother
	- when she was raising babies she had books and that was it
	- when modern parents raise babies they have too much information available and all it does is add stress
