- people love their personal stream, especially on social media sites
	
	- algorithms on those sites are built to be addicting, and are literally rewiring our brains
	
	- Ex: Tiktok brain
		
		- children and young people's attention spans are being shortened due to the instant gratification the app provides
		
		- highly affects young people because brains are not fully developed (Is “TikTok Brain” Affecting Kids?, 2022)

- it takes more work to build your own network of ideas (a Garden) than sit there and be hit by an algorithm that already knows what you want to see (a Stream)
