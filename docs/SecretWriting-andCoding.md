Reading: Dooley, History of Cryptography

**Cryptology and Secrets**

- systems for secret writing
	
	- cryptanalysis: systems for revealing those secrets

- function of in groups and out groups

- need someone to keep these secrets

**Assemblage of Encryption**

- need certain things in order for it to come together

- why was anyone even wanting to decipher things

- Godfrey letter

**Patterns of Communication

- map things out and end up with a network

	- EX: dudes in Boston in 1790s and what groups they belong to
	
	- Paul Revere ties all of those guys together

- not just what is in the message, but the pattern of how it moves

**Code:**

variabel sized elements that have meaning in the plaintext language

**Cipher:**

transformation from plaintext according to some transformation

**Polybius & Ancient Greece**

- writer in 2nd ce BC

- used Polybius square
	
	- write out alphabet and use signal torches that correspond with letters

- scytale
	
	- Spartan cipher, long strip of leather winded around rod with letters written on it

**Good Old Caesar**

- Caesar shift
	
	- write out alphabet and shift it by x letters
	
	- then write in that new alphabet

**Al Kindi**

- one of the great philosophers

- accumulated wisdom of Greece and Rome is translated into Arabic

- Al Kindi works out how to defeat ciphers by counting number of symbols

- languages have statistical properties
	
	- look for frequencies and look backwards for that

**Europe at the Time**

- Roger Bacon
	
	- has manuscript describing various systems  of secret writing
	
	- he himself used a grille 

- Early modern  Europe
	
	- moveable type is also a marker for this period
		
		- faster circulation of ideas
	
	- hard to have ideas without interest of the church
	
	- need secret writing that cannot be broken
	
	Francis Bacon
	
	- can represent all 24 letters of english alphabet with two letters (a,b) if you do it in groups of five
	
	- similar to how binary code works with 1s and 0s

**Nomenclators**

- mixture of substitution cyphers and codebooks

- still susceptible to frequency analysis and context-dependent guessing

- popular in diplomatic circles 1400- 1800ish

**Chappe Telegraph**(1793-1854)

- get up on a tall building/tower with beams that can sit at angles

- system of stations to send messages to each other

**Questions to Ponder**

- where are the gaps?

- where are the women?

- who/what is left out?

- what other things had to have happened to support all this?
