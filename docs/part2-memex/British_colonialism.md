- the spinoffs of British colonialism are insane
- Brits wanted to get telegraph lines to India to quell uprisings in their colonized territory
	- Sepoy Rebellion (Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838-1939 on JSTOR, n.d.)

- need for communication -> widespread telegraph systems -> eventual globalization of communication
