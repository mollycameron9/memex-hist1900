"The best technology is worthless if it is too costly to be used" (Coopersmith, 2015)

- competing tech worked better and was cheaper in comparison to fax
- liberalization of phone networks (post-1960s) helped improve economic advantage of faxing 

- fax market was uncertain, many developers and users also used competing tech (Coopersmith, 2015)
	- would this not have also kind of led to the downfall of fax?
	- why were people investing in fax still if the other stuff was better?
