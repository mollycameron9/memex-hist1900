Telegraph accelerator: European empires needed communication (p. 561)

Telegraph decelerator: The wires couldn't survive underwater, they needed insulation (p. 563)

Enter gutta percha, and even more colonialism! The Western European empires ravaged their colonies in Southeastern Asia for the magic gum that would insulate their wires so they could further communicate on how to deplete more colonies of their resources! 

Gutta percha manufacturers were set up in the West, most notably in East London , and so begins a globalization of the product. Harvest in Southeastern Asia, ship to Western Europe, and create products like pipes, shoes, and toys (p.564).

Colonies that gutta percha was found in include: 
- British Malaya and Sarawak
- Dutch Java, Sumatra, and Borneo
- French Mekong region of Vietnam
- Spanish Philippines (p.567)
