### Summary & Key Take Aways
Social Need for Telegraph:
- before telegraph network, messages could only travel as fast as a messenger could physically take them
	- telegraphs collapsed space and time by allowing for quicker communication via telegraph network (p.560)
- expansion of European empires in late 18th ce:
	- needed communication w/colonies, needed communication w/militaries (p.562)

Competences for Telegraph
- Gutta percha was key to success of long, underwater, cables

What is gutta percha?
- natural plastic
- sap/gum from certain rainforest trees in Southeast Asia
	- similar chemical composition to rubber

Environmental impacts of gutta percha:
-  monstrous amounts of trees were being cut down for the harvest of gutta percha
- some species of tree were becoming extinct in many regions (p.574)
- huge demand for telegraph was unsustainable for the resources needed to construct it

The discovery of gutta percha in Southeast Asia was originally a positive thing for the European empires that were attempting to construct telegraph networks across the world. The material provided insulation for the cables, and allowed for underwater telegraph lines. However, the harvesting practices were unsustainable, and had devastating effects on many species of trees. Gutta percha was an example of colonial powers decimating resources in land that they should not have had access to in the first place.
