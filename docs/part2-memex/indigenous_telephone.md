Did the Canadian government/telephone companies run telephone lines through Indigenous lands?

Were the Indigenous communities able to access this technology?

There were physical markers of the telephone networks:
	railroads, pipelines, etc (MacDougall, 2013)
Did these also run through Indigenous lands?
