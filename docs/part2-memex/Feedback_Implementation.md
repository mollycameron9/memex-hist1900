Implementing Feedback from Part 1

---

**Summaries:**

After receiving feedback to include concrete summaries on my source notes, each source note includes a concrete summary of the reading.

**Titles of source notes:**

In my first memex, my source notes were not titled with the cite key/source title. That has been changed in this version of the memex.

**Organization/Map of content**:

My first memex was not very organized, and the feedback said to implement a map of my content. The memex has been reorganized, and a map of all content with links to separate maps for Part 1 & 2 has been included.

**Canvas**

In the first memex, I improperly inserted the screenshots of my canvas. I now have a working image of canvases from both Part 1 & 2.

**Interlinkages**

The feedback said to create stronger interlinkages between my notes, and I believe that this iteration of the memex does a better job at that than the first one. I also believe that the working image of the canvas helps demonstrate these connections visually.
