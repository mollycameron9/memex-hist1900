### Technologies

*Telegraph 
- electricity transmission on wires was possible, talk of "magic needles"
- Claude Chappe used code on clocks to send messages, then developed system to be able to send a message 10 miles away
- French govt needed fast communication for military purposes
	- 1799 Napoleon ordered extended telegraph networks
- accelerated into England
	- 1816 Ronalds developed electric telegraph based on similar dial system

*Morse Code*
- already had somewhat of a telegraph system in Europe, electromagnetism was discovered
- Morse missed the news of his wife's death due to slow communication methods -> motive
- the Code:
	- short and long bursts -> dots and dashes to record incoming signals automatically
- also had many other dudes building similar telegraph systems
- systems could be used by govts, to communicate with families, etc

*Telegraph Networks*
- first interconnection agreement was between Prussia and Austria (Oct 3, 1849 (that's my birthday!))
- similar agreements popped up all over Europe soon after
- they already had the tech in place,  why not connect it and communicate even further
- New York, Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Company
	- established because of social need to connect Transatlantically
	- people went crazy when the telegraph from EU to NA worked
	- but then it failed, perhaps as a result of hiring inexperienced scientist Whitehouse
	- Whitehouse blamed everyone except him, TLDR he was cancelled!!
- Thomson eventually laid a successful cable across the Atlantic
	- people could communicate quicker than ever
	- networks were coming together

*Legacy*
- Morse ultimately died with less money than the entrepeneurs who built companies off of his design
	- capitalism strikes again!!

**Summary**
Telegraph lines once started as whisperings and rumours, but with the right materials and the right ideas eventually they came to fruition. Many people attempted telegraph system prototypes including Claude Chappe and Francis Ronalds, which were picked up by governments and implemented for communication purposes. Eventually this developed into international, and later intercontinental, telegraph networks that allowed for communication across the globe at record speeds.
