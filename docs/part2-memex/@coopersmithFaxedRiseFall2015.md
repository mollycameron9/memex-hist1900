### Summary & Key Take Aways

- fax machine: a machine that electronically transmits an image

- three main components: scanner-transmitter, transmitting medium, receiver-recorder
	- supporting tech, social & economic environments, etc has changed since invention in 1843

- often viewed as a failed technology:
	- marketers failed to deliver on promises made during promotions
	- soon after faxing picked up steam it was thwarted by the internet, cell phones, PDFs, etc

- rising capabilities of fax machines led to expectations for technology rising
	- consumers too optimistic about promotional promises led to disappointment

Fax machines have always been seen as a failed technology, even before they really took off. Even though the supporting technologies changed over time, faxing remained a similar system as its invention in 1848. Based on social need and economic demand, fax machines went in and out of style, and eventually peaked after the 1960s. Competing,  better technology, combined with marketers making empty promises, led to fax machines going out of style.
