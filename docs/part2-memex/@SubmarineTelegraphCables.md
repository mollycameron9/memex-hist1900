### Summary & Key Take Aways

- telecommunications involved in business, economics, international  politics
	- companies as global enterprises & diplomatic/military power 

- 1850s-1911 Britain dominated North Atlantic Ocean
	- challenged by political rivals but also by competing tech 

- telegraph cables existed, but to put them underwater insulation was needed
	- discovery of *gutta percha* -> isoprene -> insulation

- first long-distance underwater cables were used by French & British militaries
	- by 1862, 11 364 miles of cable was laid and only 25% worked

-  even today, telecommunications are operated by a small number of corporations
- major changes over the past century are the appearance of Japan and USA thwarting Britain for domination
- economic and strategic alignments of a handful of nations

Telegraph systems were needed in the 1800s for communication. First, they needed to invent a system, then implement it, then improve it. Many barrier occurred in the development of a working, international telegraph network including a lack of insulation for underwater cables. Once gutta percha was discovered, it provided the insulation to lay cables underwater, including across the Atlantic. There were environmental spin offs to this, as well as other impacts.
