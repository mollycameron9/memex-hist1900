### Summary & Key Take Aways
*A Fight with an Octopus*, written by Paul Latzke in 1906, is one recounting of how telephony expanded in America through competition between the Bell telephony octopus and independents (p. 2). The competition for expansion was also influenced by politics and government, and how that turned into the communication system we now have in the USA and Canada. It discusses how there are regional differences in the expansion of the telephone. MacDougall notes that there is erasure in the history of many technologies, as it is written about when it is new, but once it becomes familiar, it loses our attention (p. 4).  More specifically, the history that is forgotten is the history outside of corporations, independent movements are lost in the fray of companies like AT&T. 

While networks were generally a positive thing, they also had the power to threaten small communities, which makes me wonder about how this affected Indigenous communities in Canada. Along with this, many smaller companies were being absorbed into fewer large companies, leading to the growth of big business (8). Telephony was not without its politics, and the histoy and development of it affected many people and businesses.
