- Morse telegraph:
	- given money to build but the state owns it
	- jk the state didnt like it so they sold it back to Morse

- emergence of corporations (19th ce) + need to buy and sell stocks =  material impact on internet
	- stock market people see ticker tape, becomes standard tech
	- location of data centres, instant trading, etc

- newspapers
	- emerge in 19th century
	- compression of space and time
	- plagiarism, reprinting, but it's a network!!

- multiple telegraph services emerging = multiple lawsuits
	- eventually Morse triumphs in courts over a bunch of other guys
	- (Morse was a nepotism baby)
- by the end of 1860s only Western Union remained

- attitude that govt enterprises cannot be profitable builds
	- people want privatized businesses
	- rhetoric of what govt should be in charge of starts to  grow

- implications for colonialism
	- as the telegraph expands, commercial people find new markets and sources of material
		- you don't get the communist manifesto without implications of international markets
	- with the telegraph, what's stopping a state from expanding its reach?
