"This time it will be different" ((Coopersmith, 2015))

- reminds me of how nowadays every generation of  iPhone is basically the same
	- in a difference to  the fax however I think  consumer expectations remain stable
	- with fax, expectations rose and the  tech couldn't keep up
	- people expect iPhones to be the same as they always are, but maybe with a  better camera or battery life
- pretty much everything is the same
	- seriously, when was the last fascinating invention with as much signifance as a cell phone or a fax machine made available to the  general public
- this time it will not be different, I think
