**Cave Dots

- amateur French archaeologist has theories about cave dots

- context changes the message
	
	- caves hard to get to, information not  easily accessible

**The Medium is the Message**

- sometimes the medium is more important than the message itself

- internet: net is all about connecting messages 

- we extend our minds into these media

- when we have a new media, it changes how we interact with the old media
	
	- ex: car extends our abilities to move, the more we use it the more it forecloses earlier ways to get  around

- we lose the benefits of old media once new  media overtakes it

- medium: something that carries something else
	
	- the things that do the carrying matter

- media come in different classes or kinds of things

- who decides that something is important?
	
	- classification of this controls knowledge, power, boundaries
	
	- classifications reflect and direct our thinking

**Media in the Context of Communication**

- as far as we know humans are the only creatures to make info rich marks on other material (writing, drawing)
	
	- these extend human cognition
	
	- extend us into the future

- clay tablets, bronze tablets, wooden slabs, writing in knots
	
	- greek, roman, easter island, incan
	
	- used to communicate
	
	- character based symbols or knots
	
	- early ages of writing systems
		
		- emerges out of needs to count

- ancient writing systems were mark of power
	
	- the medium itself leads to a permanence
		
		- libraries built as a result of importance 
	
	- needed to be trained to read, write and translate
		
	- was no easy task, took alot of infrastructure

- correlations with sound did not exist at first
	
	- developed out of several factors
	
	- sound values associated with irl things

- Mari
	
	- city at start of third millenium
	
	- arranged around cyclical trade w Greece and India
	
	- has an archive of over 3000 letters written in scripts

- Rome
	
	- writing on papyrus, wax tablets, more sophisticated media
	
	- control for correspondence of the state
		
		- archives and libraries
		
		- also connected w the mint
	
	- [[roman-library]]
		
		- refined leisure
		
		- place of selection, collection, curation, conspicuous consumption
		
		- organized by genre or author

**Thus**

- the medium itself is as important as the message 
	
	- medium puts a different spin/colour on the message
	
	- how it extends our abilites to think, see the world, etc

- how we classify media/messages has implications for power, control & discipline

- writing/counting intimately connected

- infrastructure for writing spills out and has impacts on society

- libraries reflect the world back to itself
	
	- there is no natural way to organize materials in a library
	
	- gives power to person in charge

**Communication Methods**

- Korean moveable type (1377) used for jikji
	
	- ceramic
	
	- each letter symbol can move in different formats/ways

- tension in communication forms 

- Melvil Dewey
	
	- develops classification system for libraries
	
	- Dewey decimal system
		
		- if new ideas emerge we can alwasy add another decimal to slot the book in where it ought to go
		
		- philosophy, theology, government, philology, nature, history
	
	- reflects a privileged lens

- Library of Congress systems
	
	- what do we have and how can we help people find it
	
	- reflects bias of Congress' interests

- Emergence of digital computer
	
	- happens in a context through people who were educated with these biases in mind
	
	- when they think ab info organization these are the things they draw on

- the Memex
	
	- the computer could change how we organize knowledge
	
	- this is a medium changeover
	
	- associative indexing and bidirectional link
		
		- document might self organize and form its own connections
	
	- hypertext
		
		- project Xanadoo did not happen
		
		- but as a design language it was hugely influential

**Thus**

- no natural way for docs/info to be organized

- there is no one scheme

- whoever develops a scheme is in a position of power relevant to who uses that scheme

- digitization of knowledge is built for who these classifications are known

- electronic document inspires new ideas

- physicality has impacts in the world and this has changed over time

- every phase of the internet has classification shifts
