- potentially a credit to Francis Bacon 
	- memory, reason, and  imagination -> history, philosophy and belles lettres 
	- organization of the Decimal system
	- Dewey adapted his system from Harris' classification scheme which was based on Bacon's  (Wiegand, 1998)
- so many of these systems (Bacon's, Harris', etc) are highly similar and who is to say whether Dewey took inspiration from them or not
	- there are only so many ways to organize something, at what point are there no more new methods of organization?
- socio-institutional influences:
	- Dewey took on a job accounting books for his college library 
	- studied many different libraries and took influence to reorganize and catalogue the Amherst College Library (Wiegand, 1998)
		- hence "Amherst Method"
