### Summary & Key Take Aways

- instead of sharing your experience with the world (Twitter, blog), what would happen if you kept it in a wiki log
	- share and compare with other people's wikis
	- this seems oddly similar to a memex...
	- how much of doing this would help filter out unnecessary information, like Bush talked about
- the things you write up will form a deep network 
	- visual representation of your brain and what you have learned
- the Garden:
	- old metaphor for the web
	- the web as topology 
	- arrangement and rearrangement of things 
	- multi linear
	- the original garden may be Bush's memex
- the Stream
	- timeline of events and information on the web that form a narrative
	- serialization, our experience at the centre of the path
	- influenced by social media sites (Twitter, Facebook)
- get your head out of the Stream and build yourself a Garden
