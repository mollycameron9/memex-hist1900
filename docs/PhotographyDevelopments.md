@bushWeMayThink1945

- Bush talks heavily about how photography will continue to progress as an example of change in technology
	- specifically discusses a walnut sized pseudocamera (Bush, 1945)
- this vision has been realized
	- think about an iPhone
	- Apple hardly advertizes anything but the camera quality on new iPhones
	- a good camera is a selling point for the phones
- what are the spinoffs of this?
	- for the first time in history you can take extremely high quality pictures quickly and conveniently
	- think about how much more history we are able to capture than previous generations?
		- what if the ancient Greeks could have recorded their plays? etc
	- on the other hand we are able to take pictures and record so much crap that Bush's point of significant ideas getting lost in the masses is very relevant
